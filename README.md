# hangman-code
Simple hangman game in Python.

This game selects any random word from a simple python package to generate random english words and asks you to guess character for that word.
(The word can be any word, but cannot use numbers or special characters. You will have to input guess letter.)

You will get chances(trials/wrong guesses) depending upon the word size to guess a word. When you guesses correct character or repeat already guessed character then your chance will not be counted but when you gives wrong character your chance will be reduced by one.

If your guess is correct you will be awarded points depending on word length and if your guess is wrong your points will be deducted depending on word length.
It has text file which stores scores of players in desending order.

Hope you enjoy this game. Any modification in this game would be highly appreciated.
